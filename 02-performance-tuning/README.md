## What it shows

- Slow query simulation
- Execution plan analysis
- Index optimization
- Before/after performance comparison

## Workflow

1. Generate test data
2. Run slow query
3. Capture execution plan
4. Add indexes
5. Compare performance

## Outcome

Demonstrates practical SQL Server performance tuning techniques commonly used in production systems.
